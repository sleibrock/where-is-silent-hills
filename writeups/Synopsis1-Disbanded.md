Disbanded
============

Team Silent is the main development team behind the Silent Hill series. After initially tracking all members of the Silent Hill team, there were only 12 people who worked on the first three games, and then four people who worked on all four initial titles.

The number of people working on these titles quickly diminished with each entry, and it seems that the successful talent moved up the Konami ladder, while others either left the company or went to other development teams.

As all the other Silent Hill entries are made by Western teams, it's easy to say the original Team Silent is long gone, and is not coming back. Some Silent Hill members did join the Kojima Productions group in Konami, to then work on some Metal Gear titles like MGS4 and onwards.

Even before analyzing the team behind Death Stranding (or even analyzing other Metal Gear titles earlier than that), suffice to say a lot of the original talent is long gone, and some are so far removed that we will have no original Silent Hill members working on a "Silent Hills" game.

Silent Hill was said to be a team made up of "failures", so it can be ascertained that Konami is not likely to bring the series back. Since Silent Hill has been on a steady decline of popularity in the gaming industry, that would also add to it not coming back.
