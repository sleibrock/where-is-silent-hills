Some Hope
============

There was a small staff team that worked on the original "P.T." project in 2014, and then in 2015 when the Konami/Kojima break-up occurred, "P.T."'s fate was completely unknown. It was an original theory of mine that Kojima had gathered up all the staff for the "P.T." project and had taken them with him to the newly independent Kojima Productions.

However, that is not the case.

After gathering all the staff members from the Death Stranding credits, I ran a comparison of a set intersection against staff from both "P.T." and from Death Stranding, and the results are interesting: only seven people worked on both.

```
; names of all members from both P.T. and Death Stranding
Soojin Kim, Shota Hirasawa, Hiroyuki Nakayama, Yasuhiro Ikoma, Masahiro Nose, Hideo Kojima, Ludvig Forssell
```

This leaves out a lot of names from the "P.T." credits. The missing staff must still be either employed by Konami currently, or went to work elsewhere after the "P.T." project.

Which develops into another idea to prove who may still remain: Konami makes a number of games, and in 2015 and onwards, started publishing on different platforms, such as PC, mobile systems like iOS and Android, the 3DS and Nintendo Switch, and possibly more.

Konami has many classic titles like Castlevania and Contra, while also still owning the Metal Gear Solid intellectual property. Hence, after Kojima's departure, Konami started a new Metal Gear entry called Metal Gear Survive. It's possible that using the staff from the "P.T." project, they could have went to work on this. Metal Gear Survive came out in 2018, a bit before Death Stranding.

So it's possible they used whatever staff they thought they would use on Silent Hill and moved them to Metal Gear Survive. We will have to check the credits for Metal Gear to prove this idea.
