Where is Silent Hills?
=====================

This is a data/statistics project to see where the game series "Silent Hill" is after all these years.

## Backstory

Silent Hill, the horror game series, first started on the PlayStation 1 (PSX) back in 1999. It was published by Konami and developed by a group Team SIlent. Team Silent made games Silent Hill 1 all the way through Silent Hill: The Room (otherwise known as Silent Hill 4), then the group was disbanded, and several members went along different paths.

In 2014, as part of a demo for the PlayStation 4, players could download the game "P.T.", an experimental horror demo game. It was a very interesting experiment, but it turned out to be a demo for a game titled "Silent Hills", supposedly developed by the legendary Konami director and producer Hideo Kojima, and also worked on by Guillermo Del Toro, and features the Walking Dead star Norman Reedus.

Unfortunately, in 2015 after the release of "Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain", Hideo Kojima parted ways with Konami and took control of his own development group Kojima Productions. They later announced their upcoming game ["Death Stranding"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMaxrryH0es) featuring again Norman Reedus, and even featuring TV star from "Hannibal" Madds Mikkelsen. Death Stranding was also being worked on by Del Toro, so it's assumed that the game "Silent Hills" was dead forever because of how familiar these names were.  

Now in 2021 and onwards, where in the world is Silent Hills?

## Thesis Idea

The primary objective is to document all staff members who worked on Silent Hill. By taking names from the credits of every game, we can track who left and who joined Team Silent (and the other studios) in the development of each Silent Hill game. Konami may have retained some members of the original Team Silent, and used them to develop the "P.T." demo game. But if Kojima Productions was in control of developing "P.T.", and then shifted focus to Death Stranding, then it's assumed that all members of the "P.T." development team are indeed no longer with Konami. Therefore, it's safe to assume that we will need to track names against Kojima's studio as well.

Program 1: with all the data we have, let's create a program that tracks a person's given name. `racket WhereIs.rkt <name>` will give you a timeline of the person, and if they worked on a certain game or not. It will tell you what game they first worked on, and what games they didn't work on, and possibly when they left the company.

Program 2: if Konami had serious thought about bringing back the Silent Hill series, then it may have occurred to them to re-use employees of the original games to bring it back. Perhaps by looking at how many names were working on the "P.T." project, it could tell us just how likely they were about developing it... and if those people worked on Death Stranding, then it's assumed Kojima Productions took employees with them to work on new endeavors. `racket HowLikely.rkt` will calculate the percentage of potential employees remaining with Konami, as they control the Silent Hill intellectual property.
